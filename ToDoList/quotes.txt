Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
Small habits, when compounded, lead to remarkable results.
Focus on systems over goals; the process matters more than the outcome.
Make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying for lasting change (the 'Four Laws of Behavior Change').
Start with small, incremental changes; the 1% improvement each day compounds over time.
Habit formation is not about sudden transformations but about the small decisions made consistently.
Use environment design to shape behavior; make the desired habit the easiest option.
Habit tracking builds self-awareness and reinforces consistency.
Focus on identity-based habits; change who you are to change what you do.
Habit formation is a lifestyle change, not a quick fix.
